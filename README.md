# Resume Tracker

Ever wanted to update your resume, but end up needing to re-compile everything
you've done, and then filter it down later based on what's relevant? I have.
It sucks. Enter: Resume Tracker. Resume Tracker is a way for you to host your
accomplishments online and tag them so that when it comes time to make your
resume, you can just filter it down to make something specific to each
application.

## Running Backend Tests

Backend API tests are written in Postman. You can view example requests here:

## Technologies Used

Resume Tracker is built on the MERN stack, i.e. MongoDB, Express.js, React.js,
and Node.js. It uses Postman for API testing, and bcrypt/jsonwebtoken for
authentication.
