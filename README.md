# Resume Tracker

Ever wanted to update your resume, but end up needing to re-compile everything
you've done? I have. Resume Tracker is a way for you to host your
accomplishments online and tag them so you don't have to 

# Stack

Resume Tracker is built on the MERN stack, i.e. MongoDB, Express.js, React.js,
and Node.js. It uses Postman for API testing, and bcrypt/jsonwebtoken for
authentication.
